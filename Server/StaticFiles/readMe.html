            <h2> Hagar - Key Development Challenges</h2>
            <p> Database Design and Integration: Creating a well-structured database with tables for users, followers, likes, comments, posts, and other entities is a crucial foundation. Integrating this database effectively into the application can be challenging,
                ensuring that data is stored and retrieved accurately.</p>
            <p> Server Architecture: Designing a robust server architecture with a clear separation of concerns into app.js, routers, and controllers is essential for scalability and maintainability. Coordinating these components to handle various endpoints
                and routes can be complex.</p>
            <p> Frontend Development: Developing individual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each page of the app can become unwieldy as the project grows. Ensuring consistency in design and functionality across all pages is a challenge.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h2>Amit - Key Development Challenges</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development process, we encountered several significant challenges:</p>
            <p>Admin's page - enable/disable each of the additional features/pages was a difficult task.
                <br> Server's flow management was very challenging to handle.
                <br> Pages design has taken a long time using many files for each page such as .js, .html, .css.
                <br> Login Authentication has proved to be troublesome, as I encountered many problems with hashing the password along the way.
                <br> User logged in verification - authenticating which user is logged in has taken many hours of trial and error.
                <br> Making sure that Like and Dislike buttons are not pushed simultaneously by the same user, and remembered in the next page refresh.</p>
